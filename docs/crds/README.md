# Custom resources

API group: **`messaging.mkurator.dev`** — **`v1beta1`** is the only served and
stored version (all six kinds). The earlier **`v1alpha1`** version and its
conversion webhook were removed; upgrading from a build where `v1alpha1` was ever
the etcd storage version (≤ v0.12) requires the one-time stored-object
rewrite+prune in [UPGRADE.md](../UPGRADE.md) *first*
([ADR-0026](../adr/0026-v1beta1-graduation-plan.md), [API_STABILITY.md](../API_STABILITY.md)).

Field-level reference pages (every `spec`/`status` field) are being added per
kind; the field tables are generated from the CRD OpenAPI schema by
`task docs:crd-ref` and augmented with hand-written prose. All six kinds are
covered: **[QueueManagerConnection](queuemanagerconnection.md)**,
**[Queue](queue.md)**, **[Topic](topic.md)**, **[Channel](channel.md)**,
**[ChannelAuthRule](channelauthrule.md)**, **[AuthorityRecord](authorityrecord.md)**.
